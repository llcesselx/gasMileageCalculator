#  Gas Mileage Calculator

#### Problem:
Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. 

Develop a program that will input the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. The program should calculate and display the miles per galllon obtained for each tankful. After processing all of the information, the program should calculate and print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls.

#### Sample input/output:

```
Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 12.8
Enter the miles driven: 287
The miles/gallon for this tank was: 22.421875

Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 10.3
Enter the miles driven: 200
The miles/gallon for this tank was: 19.417475

Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): 5
Enter the miles driven: 120
The miles/gallon for this tank was: 24.000000

Enter the gallons used (-1 to end): -1
The overall average miles/gallon was: 21.601423
```
